# EmotionSense
EmotionSense is a Python-based project that detects human emotions in real-time using facial expressions through a webcam. It uses the DeepFace library for emotion analysis and OpenCV for capturing video frames and drawing bounding boxes around detected faces.

The model identifies emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprise, neutral, and more by analyzing facial features. It's a lightweight and beginner-friendly application suitable for learning about computer vision and affective computing.
